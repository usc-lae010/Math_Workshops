Discrete Mathematics embraces several topical areas of mathematics and is the study of objects and systems that assume only distinct values, such as integers. In this course, you learn how to work with mathematical reasoning to solve problems in set and number theory, logic and proofs, Boolean algebra, combinatorics, elementary probability, relations and functions, recursion, graph theory, and algorithm development as it applies to computer science.# Math_Workshops.
